## Reflaction

This assignment allows me to explore datasets with different kinds of data types and purposes. I  have learned how to transform and map data from one data form to another format. Changing the datatypes was the first thing I worked on since the type of data influences the operation that we can perform. I used the `set_index()` method to set a column on the data frame as an index to structure the columns of different types to aggregate, transform and filter the data, `apply()` method to pass a function and apply it on every single value to segregate data according to the condition required. 

I have learned to perform statistics to columns with numerical data using methods such as mean(), median(), min(), and max(), after categorizing columns using the `groupby()` function to split the data into groups based on some criteria, for example, by age, by gender, and year. Also, I was able to compute specific combinations of aggregating statistics for given columns using the `agg()` method.






# Reflection Questions

#### 1. What do I believe I did well on this assignment?


I have used different pandas methods and functions to structure, apply, split, filter, and transform data. I grouped the data columns according to the specific criteria and performed mathematical computation on it. 

### 2. What was the most challenging part of this assignment?

Understanding the statistical operations and how to perform statistical computations on the categorized columns was a little bit challenging at first. Also, Aggregating multiple columns to get a single value.



### 3. What would have made this assignment a better experience?


I got a good experience of learning to use these methods and functions to solve the given problems, which gave me a chance to practice more and work with different kinds of operations to get the best result. Having a good experience of the statistical methods and how to use them efficiently to the given specific task could make it a better experience.

### 4. What do I need help with?

The class lecture was helpful to understand the general idea of the purpose of using these methods and functions and how to use them according to the given problem. I need help with implementing the best and efficient ways to perform the given task based on their statistical impact.
