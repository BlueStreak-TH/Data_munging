## Reflaction

This assignment allows me to explore datasets with different kinds of data types and purposes. I  have learned how to transform and map data from one data form to another format. Changing the datatypes was the first thing I worked on since the type of data influences the operation we can perform. I used set_index(), apply(), and groupby() methods to set a column on the data frame as an index to structure the columns of different types and aggregate, transform and filter the data. Besides, I was able to manipulate statistical operations such as mean(), median(), max(), and min().
